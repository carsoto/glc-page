A quick and easy way to create Popup layers with the Divi Visual Builder!

== Description ==

No configuration needed. Simply activate the plugin and add the CSS class "popup" and ID tag to a divi section. To open the popup you only need to place a link on the page with the URL pointing to the section ID.

Example:

1. Edit a section and set the ID to "newsletter-optin" and CSS class to "popup"
2. Add a link (or button, etc) on the page with the URL "#newsletter-optin"
3. All done, save the page! When a visitor clicks on your new link the popup will be opened.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much performance does Popups for Divi need? =

Actually none! We designed it with maximum page performance in mind. Our tests did show literally no change in page loading speed.

The plugin will add a single line of CSS to the page output and load one JS and CSS file that currently are about 7 kb in size and are cached by the browser after first page load.

= Is Popups for Divi compatible with Caching plugins? =

Yes, absolutely! There is no dynamic logic in the PHP code like other popup plugins have. Popups for Divi is a little bit of PHP but the main logic sits inside the small javascript library it provides. It works on the client side, and therefore is not restricted by caching plugins.

= Is this plugin compatible with every Divi version? =

This plugin is kept compatible with the latest Divi release.

We did test it with all releases since the initial Divi 3.0 release. Possibly it will also work with older versions, but it is not confirmed yet.

= Does this plugin also work with other themes/site builders? =

Yes, actually it will! But out of the box it is optimized to work with Divi. If you use any other theme or site builder then you need to change the default options of the plugin via the `evr_divi_popup-js_data` filter.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is a normal Divi page, before adding a popup.
2. Step 1: Modify the section and add the "popup" class, as well as an ID.
3. Step 2: Add the popup-ID as a button link. Clicking this button will show the popup.
4. That's all. Save the page and open it up without the editor. All popups are initially hidden.
5. Click on the "Contact" button displays the popup. You can style the Divi section (change the width, background-color, etc) or customize the CSS of the popup...
